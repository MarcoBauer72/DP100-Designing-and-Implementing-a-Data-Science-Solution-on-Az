But for subsequent runs, as long as the dependencies (`conda_packages` parameter in the above estimator constructor) don't change, the same image is reused and hence the container start up time is much faster.\n\nHere is what's happening while you wait:\n\n- **Image creation**: A Docker image is created matching the Python environment specified by the estimator. The image is built and stored in the ACR (Azure Container Registry) associated with your workspace. Image creation and uploading takes **about 5 minutes**. \n\n  This stage happens once for each Python environment since the container is cached for subsequent runs.  During image creation, logs are streamed to the run history. You can monitor the image creation progress using these logs.\n\n- **Scaling**: If the remote cluster requires more nodes to execute the run than currently available, additional nodes are added automatically. Scaling typically takes **about 5 minutes.**\n\n- **Running**: In this stage, the necessary scripts and files are sent to the compute target, then data stores are mounted/copied, then the entry_script is run. While the job is running, stdout and the files in the ./logs directory are streamed to the run history. You can monitor the run's progress using these logs.\n\n- **Post-Processing**: The ./outputs directory of the run is copied over to the run history in your workspace so you can access these results.\n\n\nYou can check the progress of a running job in multiple ways. This tutorial uses a Jupyter widget as well as a `wait_for_completion` method. \n\n### Jupyter widget\n\nWatch the progress of the run with a Jupyter widget.  Like the run submission, the widget is asynchronous and provides live updates every 10-15 seconds until the job completes."
